<blockquote class="quoteback" data-title="Open Transclude for Networked Writing" data-author="Toby Shorin" cite="http://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/">
The web is still a very young medium, and it has been influenced more than anything else by print media design. <strong>There is so much more that can be done with text on a screen than is being done today.</strong> Citations, drawing, chat, speech-to-text. There are opportunities everywhere, and the bar is low! If we are serious about unlocking the value of knowledge we should consider how to improve every part of the knowledge production stack, and that includes reading. As <a href="http://beautiful-company.com/i/printed-matter-website" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laurel Schwulst says</a>: “Imaginative functionality is important, even if it’s only a trace of what was, as it’s still a sketch for a more ideal world.”
